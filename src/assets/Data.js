        productDescription: "For sell (1) 2 oz & (1) 4 oz bottles of Swen's Swedish Oil (more like a Cream). Nice lemon smell. MUST TRY.  This old school formula has been handed down for generations I have been re finishing wood for over 40 years, This one of the best product i have ever used, By far better then polish it moisturizes the wood as well as protects it. No silicone, All natural ingredients.  Although this product does have some cleaning properties i.e. sticker glue, smudges, there is no substitute for proper cleaning methods.  This product is formulated to renew, restore and protect.  It can be used on a variety of surfaces like wood, leather, metal and fiberglass.  Would advise that on other surfaces a small test be preformed before using on entire object.  I have used it to restore antique items with great results.  It can also be used as a finish on unfinished items but will require multiple applications. It helps to prevent rusting on metal surfaces.   To apply just add a small amount to a cloth and apply to surface, let it sit for 10 -15 minutes and wipe off . If using for finish on raw or stained wood apply, then use 600 grit wet or dry sand paper or 0000 steel wool and burnish it into the wood, let it sit for 20 -30 minutes and wipe off, repeat after 8 - 10 hours till finish is achieved. Also works great on inside of glass shower doors once a month. A little bit goes a long ways This Formula is not for consumption but I have other formulas for use on cutting boards & wooden utensils.   Larger size bottles available. Will give shipping discount on multiple bottle orders        Free shipping on 4 or more bottles",
